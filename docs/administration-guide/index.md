# OntoPortal Administration Guide

Installation and maintenance documentation for OntoPortal. It focuses on system administration.

There are different ways to install OntoPortal.

- > The recommended approach is by getting and installing the {{site.opva}} as provided by [Stanford BMIR](https://bmir.stanford.edu/) which keeps trace of all the uses and assigns free licenses. This Appliance is based on BioPortal codebase and packaged roughly once a year. For this, please contact **Alex Skrenchuk** at <alex.skrenchuk@stanford.edu>.
- > A custom version of the {{site.opva}} is distributed by [INRAE MISTEA](https://mistea.montpellier.hub.inrae.fr/) which is based on AgroPortal codebase. For this, please contact **Clement Jonquet** at <clement.jonquet@inrae.fr>.
- > The [`ontoportal_docker`](https://github.com/ontoportal/ontoportal_docker) repository provides a containerized installation of OntoPortal intended primarily for developers and evaluation purposes, rather than production deployments. While it is actively maintained, we currently offer only limited support for this installation method.
- > The [`ontoportal-deployment`](https://github.com/ontoportal/ontoportal-deployment) repository provides deployment resources for setting up a containerized OntoPortal instance using Docker and Kubernetes. It is designed for more robust and scalable deployments, including production environments, although it requires familiarity with container orchestration and infrastructure management.


The documentation generally holds for any version of {{site.opva}} which current version is {{site.release_version}}. When something is specific for a version of the Appliance the page displays alternative pages.
