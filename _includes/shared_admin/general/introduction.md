# Introduction

The {{site.opva}} is build as a copy of the BioPortal ontology repository software 
that you can run on your own system. 
You can install it following the instructions in this documentation, 
and upload your own ontologies or other kind of semantic resources.

You can visit the <a href="https://ontoportal.org/">OntoPortal web site</a>
to learn more about the capabilities of the OntoPortal system and see examples of portals running the software.

## How is the Appliance packaged?

The OntoPortal Virtual Appliance image contains 
a pre-installed, pre-configured version 
of the OntoPortal open source software running on a Linux operating system.

It is available as a VMWare Virtual Appliance OVA, as well as an Amazon Web Service AMI, 
and can be obtained by following the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/administration-guide/steps/getting_started">Getting Started</a> section in this manual.
